### 1. ❤️ [Heart Disease Risk Prediction]()
A machine learning project that builds and evaluates classification models to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient health data.

The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. It includes feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and performance assessment using accuracy and confusion matrices. A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier was among the models explored.

📔**Libraries Used**
- Pandas and NumPy – for data handling and numerical operations
- Seaborn and Matplotlib – for data visualization
- Scikit-learn (sklearn) – for:
  - Train-test splitting
  - Feature scaling (MinMaxScaler)
  - Model training (KNeighborsClassifier)
  - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay)
